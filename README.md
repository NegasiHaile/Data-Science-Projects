Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects

1. [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/NegasiHaile/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) of the Breast Cancer
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Decision Tree Classification and Logistic Regression
   - **Results:** The logistic regression gave 97% accuracy and decision tree gave 93.5% accuracy
2. [Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/NegasiHaile/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Red%20Wine%20Quality)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the quality of the wine in the value 0 or 1. 1 for good quality and 0 for bad quality
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and knn
   - **Results:** The logistic regression model performs the best with accuracy of 86.67%
3. [Heart Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/NegasiHaile/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Heart%20Stroke%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the risk of heart stroke on studying the person's demographics and medical info
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and knn
   - **Results:** The logistic regression, SVM and KNN performs the best with 93.8 % accuracy
4. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/NegasiHaile/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the house price after studying the variables such as location, area, bredroom, bathroom count and many more.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Random Forest Regressor
   - **Results:** The Random Forest Regressor performed best with accuracy of 87.89%
